# c-web-server
The name is self-explanatory. This is a web server in C, which I am developing as a side-project. I don't plan on making this a "framework" yet. Maybe later.

<!-- added killing of unused child processes -->

# TODO
- try to render some HTML
- give `get_exec_path.c`, `logger.c` and `console_utils.h` own repositories

---

- routes?
- forms?
- cookies? (sessions?)

# ISSUES

- `accept()` accepts the connection twice (if connecting from browser)
